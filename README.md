# ClassSing

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

If you're reading this, you're most likely a physicist trying to prove the non-rationalizability of one or more square roots. The `ClassSing` function first appeared in my Ph.D. thesis and is a predecessor to the more mature `NonADE` function presented in [this](https://github.com/marcobesier/rationalizability-of-square-roots) repository so you may want to check this out.

## What's ClassSing?

`ClassSing` is a [MAGMA](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) function that checks whether all singularities of a given projective algebraic curve are ADE singularities.

## Why ClassSing?

[MAGMA](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) has a built-in function to check whether all singularities of a given _surface_ are of ADE type, but lacks a similar function for algebraic curves. The `ClassSing`function fills this surprising gap.
