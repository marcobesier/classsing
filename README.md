# ClassSing

## What's ClassSing?

`ClassSing` is a [MAGMA](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) function that checks whether all singularities of a given projective algebraic curve are ADE singularities.

## Why ClassSing?

[MAGMA](http://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/) has a built-in function to check whether all singularities of a given _surface_ are of ADE type, but lacks a similar function for algebraic curves. The `ClassSing`function fills this surprising gap.

## A Note For Readers of the Ph.D. Thesis

The way ClassSing is explained in my Ph.D. thesis still applies to the current version of the function. All explanations that are given below are also contained in the thesis so there is no need for you to read on. ðŸ™‚

## Usage

To use `ClassSing`, simply copy the content of classsing.txt into an open MAGMA session. Once the function is defined, you can use it as follows:

1. Fix the basefield to be the field of rational numbers.

    `QQ:=Rationals();`

2. If some of the singular-point coordinates of the given curve contain irrational numbers, adjoin these irrationalities to the basefield. For example, if a:=sqrt(5) is such an irrationality, you can adjoin it to the basefield via

    `F<a>:=ext<QQ|[Polynomial([-5,0,1])]>;`

3. Define the basering. Notice that the variables have to have the names x, y, and z.

    `K<x,y,z>:=PolynomialRing(F,3);`

4. Enter the defining polynomial of the projective curve. Example:

    `f:=(-y*(4*z*(z+y)-x*y))*(y^2*(x-4*z)+z*x*(z-2*y));`

5. Call the ClassSing function.

    `ClassSing(K,f);`
